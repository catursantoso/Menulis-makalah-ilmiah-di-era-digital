Since its inception, <i>JNRBM</i> has provided a platform for results which would otherwise have remained unpublished, and now many other journals have followed <i>JNRBM’s</i> lead in publishing articles reporting negative or null results. As such <i>JNRBM</i> has succeeded in its mission and there is no longer a need for a specific journal to host these null results. The journal will therefore be closing soon and <i>JNRBM</i>  is no longer considering new submissions.</p><p><i>Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine</i> is an open access, peer-reviewed journal that provides a platform for the publication and discussion of non-confirmatory and negative data, as well as unexpected, controversial and provocative results in the context of current tenets. The journal provides scientists and physicians with responsible and balanced information to support informed experimental and clinical decisions.</p>},
